## About 

These are optimized server configuration files for CraftBukkit/Paper/Spigot/Purpur servers. These configs feature major performance improvements, with little/negligble changes to vanilla. Last version: `1.18.1`

## Installation

Use the files at the top of this page and copy and paste them into your own! For example, if you run a PaperMC server, replace your `paper.yml` with the text from my `paper.yml` file attached above. The same process applies for the other files aswell, replace your `spigot.yml`,`bukkit.yml` with the `spigot.yml` and `bukkit.yml` abov.
